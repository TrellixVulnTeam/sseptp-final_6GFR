        <p class="course-page-content__main--description">
          Family of research in civil engineering (FORCE) play a critical role
          in the construction of infrastructure. They plan infrastructure
          projects and costs and design airports, bridges, dams, harbors and the
          highways millions of people use. Whether your career goals are
          professional satisfaction or financial success, education and planning
          can assist you in meeting those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals
          with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and
          naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges,
          canals, dams, and buildings. Engineering streams such as structural
          (STRUCTURES), transportation, geotechnical Enginneering, hydraulics,
          environmental engineering, and other areas of study are part of this
          course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faculty of the department continues to strive loftier towards
          excellence by exploring new frontiers of knowledge, imparting the
          latest technical knowledge to the students and conducting high quality
          of research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lofty is a good word for describing something that’s high above the
          ground, or someone who acts like she’s high above everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines because
          it deals with constructed environment. The Department offers programs
          at an Undergraduate level with an AICTE approved intake of 60.All the
          laboratories are furnished with state-of-the-art equipment, licensed
          software and PCs. The Department is consistently achieving good
          results over the years.

          We are now living in a world where the technology is continuously
          making rapid strides. New technologies evolve quickly making the
          current ones outdated. Unless the budding engineers are prepared to
          meet this challenge head on they would find it hard to survive. We at
          SSE provide a set of carefully tailored value added courses which will
          immerensely help them to be quickly employable. These courses are
          designed in a way that will help bridge the gap between the academic
          syllabus and the current industry practices. The value added courses
          offered are
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is conducted by the Civil and Mechanical Engineering
          departments. AutoCAD is a very popular design and drafting software
          application. AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop
          app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers. Auto
          cad supports a high degree of customization and automation.It supports
          both 2D and 3D modeling It helps architectural designers to draw 3D
          objects, such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data
          associated with them. AutoCAD is used across a wide range of
          industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic
          designers, and many other professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The courses are delivered by a team comprising of the faculty from SSE
          as well as experts from the industry . Designed as certificate courses
          , they give equal importance to the theoretical concepts as well as
          hands on practice sessions. This will help them a lot to be equipped
          to meet the challenging future.

        <h3 class="course-page-content__main--h3">Internship Programs</h3>
        <p>
          The Institute keeps keen objective to help understudies by supporting
          them to get internships throughout each semesters in well reputed
          companies that adds to their career growth by giving them practical
          experience in corporate environments along with live projects. Knowing
          the fact that Internships in companies contribute to vital part for
          career growth of individual students the programs are continuously
          conducted and students are motivated to take part for scaling up their
