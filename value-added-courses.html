          We are now living in a world where the technology is continuously
          making rapid strides. New technologies evolve quickly making the
          current ones out dated. Unless the budding engineers are prepared to
          meet this challenge head on they would find it hard to survive. We at
          SSE provide a set of carefully tailored value added courses which will
          immensely help them to be quickly employable. These courses are
          designed in a way that will help bridge the gap between the academic
          syllabus and the current industry practices. The value added courses
          offered are...

          C++ is one of the most popular programming languages. This language
          finds its use for a wide variety of System programming applications.
          System software such as Operating Systems, Compilers and interpreters
          can be developed using C++. Expertise in this language is a must for
          computer science graduates. This course is conducted by the Computer
          Science & Engineering department.

          Java is a highly popular, object-oriented and platform independent
          programming language. This language finds its usee very where. Java
          can be used to develop device control, business applications,
          client-server web applications and the Internet of Things. It is
          intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere
          (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
          support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are
          typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
          machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. In order to make
          websites look and function a certain way, web developers utilize
          different languages. The three core languages that make up the World
          Wide Web are HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. In the IT world, the internet
          is an essential platform, whether it’s for developing or for consumer
          use.

          Client-Side Markup and Scripting
        </h3>
        <p>
          Client-side technologies are things that operate in the browser. There
          is no need to interact with the server. These languages are generally
          very easy to use, and you can try them out right on your own computer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="course-page-content__main--h3">
          CSS: Cascading Stylesheets
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is what you will use to create the decoration for your house (or
          website!). CSS describes how a web page should look in the browser.
          The key to good web page creation is to completely separate the
          presentation (CSS) from the structure of your site (HTML). This way it
          is easy to make changes to the look of your site without changing all
          of your HTML files. Just like putting a new coat of paint on your
          house.
        </p>

        <h3 class="course-page-content__main--h3">JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a simple scripting language used to make things happen
          on your web page. In our home building analogy, JavaScript would be
          the hinges that make doors open and close and light switches turn on
          and off.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize the difference between JavaScript and
          some of the server-side technologies discussed below. As a client-side
          language, JavaScript only works within the browser window. It cannot
          retrieve, create, or store data on the server, it can only manipulate
          things within the browser. Things that you might use JavaScript for
          include swapping images on mouseover, check to see if form fields have
          been completed, or making a web page redirect to another page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="course-page-content__main--h3">
          Server-Side Programming Languages
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are many server-side programming languages that you can use on
          your web sites. These are languages that interact with the web server
          to manipulate data. In our home building analogy, server side
          programming would be all the functionality in the house: electrical
          wiring, plumbing, and duct work. It does stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would use a server-side language to send form data, store
          passwords and login information,or otherwise store and retrieve data
          from the server. Applications that would require a server side
          language include message boards, blogs guestbooks, and anything that
          requires users to log in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you start worrying out about learning a programming language,
          you should know that for many basic applications it isn’t necessary to
          learn how to do server-side programming. You can download and install
          many scripts with minimal effort. Of course, if you are interested in
          learning programming there are many resources available. The most
          common server side languages are PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor, open
          source) and ASP (Active Server Pages, from Microsoft).
        </p>
        <p>
          To use one of these, you need to have them enabled on your hosting
          account. Most free hosts do not offer server side languages of any
          kind. On a paid hosting account, it depends on whether you are on a
          Windows or Linux server. ASP is a windows technology and is only
          available on Windows servers. PHP is an open source language and is
          available on Linux and (sometimes) windows servers. Check with your
          hosting provider to see which one you can use with your account. .NET
          is both a business strategy from Microsoft and its collection of
          programming support for what are known as Web services, the ability to
          use the Web rather than your own computer for various services.
          Microsoft’s goal is to provide individual and business users with a
          seamlessly interoperable and Web-enabled interface for applications
          and computing devices and to make computing activities increasingly
          Web browser-oriented. The .NET platform includes servers;
          building-block services, such as Web-based data storage; and device
          software. It also includes Passport, Microsoft’s
          fill-in-the-form-only-once identity verification service.

          Net Technology is developed by Microsoft in 2000. .Net technology is
          the new addition to Windows. The .NET (“dot – net”) environment is
          effectively a “virtual computer” that runs on a real computer, through
          which a developers can create a .NET application in any .NET –
          compatible language and participate in the same software project
          writing code in the .NET languages in which (such as Visual C++.NET,
          Visual Basic .NET, C#, Java, J# and more others).

          Network Architecture Nondestructive testing (NDT) is a wide group of
          analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to
          evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without
          causing damage.[1] The terms nondestructive examination (NDE),
          nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE)
          are also commonly used to describe this technology. Because NDT does
          not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly
          valuable technique that can save both money and time in product
          evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently
          used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid
          penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing.NDT is
          commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering,
          petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering,
          systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.
          Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound
          impact on medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical
          ultrasonography, and digital radiography.
        </p>

        <p>
          Various national and international trade associations exist to promote
          the industry, knowledge about non-destructive testing, and to develop
          standard methods and training. These include the American Society for
          Nondestructive Testing, the Non-Destructive Testing Management
          Association, the International Committee for Non-Destructive Testing,
          the European Federation for Non-Destructive Testing and the British
          Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.

          It is used to check the quality of the object for any material by
          using any one of above-mentioned tests. This course is conducted by
          the Electrical & Electronics and Electronics Communication engineering
          departments. An Embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated
          function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with
          real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete
          device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems
          control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all
          microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems.
          This course is conducted by the Civil and Mechanical Engineering
          departments. AutoCAD is a very popular design and drafting software
          application. AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop
          app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers. Auto
          cad supports a high degree of customization and automation. It
          supports both 2D and 3D modeling It helps architectural designers to
          draw 3D objects, such as walls, doors and windows, with more
          intelligent data associated with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects,
          project managers, engineers, graphic designers, and many other
          professionals.. The courses are delivered by a team comprising of the
          faculty from SSE as well as experts from the industry. Designed as
          certificate courses , they give equal importance to the theoretical
          concepts as well as hands on practice sessions. This will help them a
          lot to be equipped to meet the challenging future. The world is a
          global village and knowing a foreign language helps one to utilize the
          globalization of jobs. The students at SSE learn FRENCH under the able
          guidance of Ms.Radhika.
